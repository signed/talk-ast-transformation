== Summary

=== When not to sue
- IDE already comes with a lot of transformations
  - learn what is there
  - learn what limitations there are
- Small changes that can be done quickly

=== When it is an option
- make a lot of changes across a code base
- you have tests (typescript helps, too)

=== Benefits
- No need to rebase
- can be done incrementally
- no manual work
- reusable
- you can write tests for your mods
- you learn a lot about your codebase
- its automated
- you can include project specific knowledge into your mods (harder in an IDE)

=== be pragmatic

- If there is an edge case that is hard to automate and only occurs in few places, make the change by hand in a preparation step

=== limitations

- you only change one file at a time
